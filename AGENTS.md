# HOOT — Local AI Command Center

**Portfolio path:** `D:/projects/HootAi/` — current working repo for all HOOT work (rebrand from AgentDock).

**Current version:** `2.3.1` (`VERSION` + `package.json` + `ui/package.json`). Canonical launcher: `pwsh D:\projects\scripts\start-hoot.ps1`.

HOOT is a local-only AI agent command center (engine package: `agentdock`). It scans your machine, plans agent stacks, monitors terminals, launches approved profiles, and learns from memory. It binds to `127.0.0.1` only, uses zero runtime npm dependencies, and launches only commands embedded in approved Markdown profile files.

## Quick Start

**Path note:** repo files live under `D:\projects\HootAi`. `canonical-root.js` now treats both `HootAi` and `Hoot` as canonical aliases, while `D:\projects\agentdock` remains the legacy mirror only.

```powershell
pwsh D:\projects\scripts\start-hoot.ps1
```

```bash
cd D:/projects/HootAi
node server.js
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:7777` in your browser.

## Build & Test

HOOT has **zero runtime npm dependencies**. All tests use Node.js built-in modules.

### Run All Tests

```bash
npm test
# or explicitly:
node --test tests/*.test.js
```

### Test Structure

| Test File | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| `tests/server.test.js` | HTTP server startup, `/api/status`, `/api/catalog`, `/api/profiles` |
| `tests/scanner.test.js` | Scan JSON schema, `parseOllamaPsRaw`, `normalizeLoadedModels` |
| `tests/profiles.test.js` | Frontmatter parsing, required fields, PowerShell block presence |
| `tests/memory.test.js` | `memory.md` structure, evidence block parsing, status validation |

### Adding Tests

Create a new file in `tests/`:

```js
const { describe, it } = require('node:test');
const assert = require('node:assert');

describe('my feature', () => {
  it('does something', () => {
    assert.strictEqual(1 + 1, 2);
  });
});
```

### Linting

No linter is configured by design (zero dependencies). Follow the existing style:
- 2-space indentation
- Single quotes for strings
- Semicolons optional but consistent within a file
- Use `const` / `let`, avoid `var`

## Architecture

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `server.js` | HTTP server, route handler, session manager, project registry, stack evaluation |
| `scanner.ps1` | PowerShell system scanner — detects tools, env vars, Ollama models, hardware |
| `advisor.js` | Operations advisor — rule-based + optional Gemini API integration |
| `chat.js` | AI chat / mascot controller — maintains history, processes messages |
| `profiles/*.md` | Launch profiles — frontmatter metadata + PowerShell `launch` blocks |
| `memory.md` | Local learning layer — known successes, failures, work ethos, avoided loops |
| `index.html` | Single-page dashboard — theming, keyboard shortcuts, responsive layout |
| `compatibility-rules.json` | Stack evaluation rules — model capabilities, CE compatibility, task tiers |
| `skills/compound-engineering/skills-catalog.json` | Compound Engineering skills registry |
| `scripts/sync-ce-skills.js` | Node.js script to sync CE skills from GitHub |
| `scripts/sync-ce-skills.ps1` | PowerShell script to sync CE skills from GitHub |

### Data Flow

1. **Scan** — `scanner.ps1` probes the local system and emits JSON.
2. **Evaluate** — `server.js` evaluates profiles against the scan + `memory.md`.
3. **Plan** — Build a ranked plan based on goal (privacy, fastest, cheapest, heavy, audit).
4. **Launch** — Execute a profile's PowerShell `launch` block in a monitored child process.
5. **Remember** — Outcomes are logged to `memory.md` and `state/stack-usage.json`.

## Key Files

- `server.js` — Core runtime. Exposes REST API on localhost.
- `scanner.ps1` — System probe. Outputs JSON consumed by `/api/scan`.
- `advisor.js` — Proactive advisor with optional Gemini fallback.
- `chat.js` — Session-based chat with structured command responses.
- `profiles/` — Markdown profiles defining agent stacks.
- `state/` — JSON state (projects, stack usage, sessions).
- `logs/` — Scan logs, launch logs, session transcripts.
- `briefs/` — Auto-generated research briefs.

## Integrations (Phase 1)

| Integration | Location |
|-------------|----------|
| RTK token efficiency | `state/user-settings.json`, scanner `token_efficiency` |
| MCP git catalog | `state/mcp-catalog.json`, `GET /api/mcp` |
| LM Studio settings | Settings UI, `GET/POST /api/settings`, `localInference.lmstudio`, `backend: lmstudio` / `lm-studio` local providers |
| llama.cpp settings | Settings UI, `GET/POST /api/settings`, `backend: llamacpp` profiles |
| Docs | `D:\projects\docs/AI_OS_INTEGRATIONS.md` |

Sample profiles: `local-safe-audit-llamacpp.md`, `compound-core-claude-rtk.md`

## Upstream AgentDock framework (reference only)

HOOT is **not** [AgentDock/AgentDock](https://github.com/AgentDock/AgentDock) on GitHub. That repo ships `agentdock-core` (TypeScript nodes, orchestration, evaluation) and a Next.js hub client. Portfolio policy: borrow patterns, never vendor the monorepo or add `agentdock-core` as a runtime dependency.

| Topic | Local HOOT | Upstream reference |
|-------|------------|-------------------|
| Launch / profiles | `profiles/*.md` PowerShell blocks | `agents/*/config.yaml` templates |
| Evaluation | `bench-results.js`, `/api/bench/*` | `docs/evaluations/` harness |
| Orchestration | Phase 4 `coach-graph/` (planned) | `docs/architecture/orchestration/` |
| UI | `ui/` Vite/React | Next.js hub at hub.agentdock.ai |

| Doc / skill | Path |
|-------------|------|
| External capability | `D:\projects\docs\external-capabilities\agentdock-upstream.md` |
| Portfolio skill | `D:\projects\skills\agentdock-framework\SKILL.md` |
| ECC copy | `D:\projects\ecc\skills\agentdock-framework\SKILL.md` |

**M9 bench lane:** `scripts/bench-local-models.mjs` writes `state/bench-results.csv`; `applyBenchToProfile()` adjusts stack scores for Ollama/llama.cpp models.

## UI session refresh

The React shell now uses a shared route manifest (`ui/src/lib/app-shell.ts`) so routes, nav grouping, and visibility stay aligned. The main operator split is:
- **Basic mode** — strict 5-step operator loop: Home → Readiness → Build → Launch → Session
- **Advanced mode** — full command center grouped into **Operate**, **Intelligence**, and **Configure** surfaces

Launch authority belongs in `ui/src/pages/LaunchCenterPage.tsx`. The dashboard should stay focused on readiness, active mission context, HOOT recommendations, and handoff/setup shortcuts; profile browsing and deep catalog inspection live in `ProfilesPage` under Advanced mode.

HOOT can switch modes and trigger prefab actions through typed UI control targets in `ui/src/lib/hoot-control.ts`.

While the HOOT tab is open, intelligence views auto-reload **on mount** and **every 30 minutes** (`SESSION_POLL_MS` in `ui/src/lib/session-poll.ts`). `SessionPollProvider` in `AppLayout` broadcasts `hoot:session-refresh`; pages use `useSessionPoll()`.

| Cadence | Surfaces |
|---------|----------|
| 30 min | Overview, Portfolio, Pipeline, Activity, Token Ledger, Bench, Approvals |
| 30 s | Command Deck cooldown registry (live countdowns) |

Portfolio/Pipeline passes `?refresh=1` on session ticks to re-read `MILESTONES.md` and `.agentdock/project-brain/`.

Dashboard hydration should prefer `GET /api/bootstrap` and cached scan data before falling back to multi-request fanout. Builder-first workflows should prefer prefab selection (local / cloud / hybrid) before exposing the full composer. Shell-only overlays (coach mascot, command palette, onboarding wizard, guide bar, cooldown strip) should stay lazily loaded so they do not inflate first paint. Vite modulepreload should avoid eagerly preloading heavyweight optional chunks like `coach-*` and `recharts-*`.

Session/context accuracy rules:
- The coach session id is owned by `CoachContext` and persisted in tab-scoped `sessionStorage` (`hoot_coach_session_id`). Any coach surface (`HeadCoach`, mascot thread, context refresh) must reuse that shared id rather than minting its own transient session key.
- Route/page context refreshes should call `/api/coach/context` with the shared coach session id so cached MCP/page summaries stay attached to one conversational session across route changes.
- `pageContext` remains a slim operator snapshot for routine hints; only explicit repo/memory asks should escalate to full context mode.

Token-ledger accuracy rules:
- `token-ledger.js` must bucket timestamps with the configured `timezone` rather than raw UTC date slicing; imported Claude transactions and CSV rows should land on the operator's local workday.
- `fast_recent` refreshes may reuse cached historical days, but they must preserve cached Codex session history when recomputing `work_breakdown` so totals/examples do not silently collapse to only recently touched files.
- CSV ingestion should tolerate quoted fields/embedded commas. `tests/token-ledger.test.js` covers timezone bucketing and fast-refresh work-breakdown preservation; keep those checks green when touching ledger ingestion.

Settings now treat LM Studio as a first-class local runtime alongside Ollama and llama.cpp: `localInference.preferredBackend` selects the default local engine, `localInference.lmstudio` stores host/port/protocol/basePath/defaultModel, and HOOT Brain Auto mode prioritizes Ollama → LM Studio → llama.cpp before cloud fallback. Scan/build/coach flows should surface LM Studio as part of the prefab local/cloud/hybrid decision, not bury it behind custom endpoint UX.

## Chatbot / Coach UI

Build or upgrade conversational UI with **[assistant-ui](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui)** — portfolio standard.

| Asset | Path |
|-------|------|
| Agent skill | `skills/chatbot-builder/SKILL.md` |
| Human doc | `docs/CHATBOT_BUILDER.md` |
| Portfolio standard | `D:\projects\docs\CHATBOT_STACK.md` |
| AI OS context | `D:\projects\docs\AI_OS_ARCHITECTURE.md` |

- UI packages live in `ui/` only (server stays zero runtime npm deps).
- Coach calls existing `POST /api/chat` via an assistant-ui external-store runtime.
- Launch commands from chat require UI approval before profile execution.

## Compound Engineering Integration

AgentDock integrates the [Compound Engineering](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin) skill library as an available set of build, planning, and review capabilities.

### Supported Frontends

| Frontend | CE Support | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| `claude` | Full | All 9 core CE skills available |
| `codex` | Full | All 9 core CE skills available |
| `gemini` | Converter-backed | CE blocks converted to Gemini equivalents; may drift |
| `opencode` | Converter-backed | CE blocks converted to OpenCode equivalents; may drift |
| `kimi` | None | Not compatible with CE skill library |
| `aider` | None | Not compatible with CE skill library |
| `hermes` | None | Not compatible with CE skill library |

### CE Workflow Profiles

Eight CE workflow profiles are available for `claude` and `codex`:

- **Core workflows:** `compound-core-claude.md`, `compound-core-codex.md` (brainstorm → plan → work → review)
- **Strategy workflows:** `compound-strategy-claude.md`, `compound-strategy-codex.md` (architecture + performance tasks)
- **Plan + Work workflows:** `compound-plan-work-claude.md`, `compound-plan-work-codex.md` (planning + execution)
- **Compound review workflows:** `compound-review-compound-claude.md`, `compound-review-compound-codex.md` (code review + compound analysis)

### Local Model Profiles

Local Ollama profiles are provided for lightweight and advanced tasks:

| Profile | Model | Best For | Tier |
|---------|-------|----------|------|
| `local-*-gemma4b.md` (×9) | `gemma:4b` | Light tasks (safe-audit, documentation) | `light` |
| `local-code-assist-deepseek-6.7b.md` | `deepseek-coder:6.7b` | Standard coding tasks | `standard` |
| `local-heavy-refactor-deepseek-16b.md` | `deepseek-coder-v2:16b` | Heavy refactor, architecture | `advanced` |
| `local-reasoning-deepseek-r1-8b.md` | `deepseek-r1:8b` | Reasoning tasks | `standard` |
| `local-reasoning-deepseek-r1-32b.md` | `deepseek-r1:32b` | Advanced reasoning | `advanced` |

### Syncing CE Skills

Run the sync script to download the latest CE skill definitions from GitHub:

```bash
# Node.js (cross-platform)
node scripts/sync-ce-skills.js

# PowerShell (Windows)
.\scripts\sync-ce-skills.ps1
```

This populates `skills/compound-engineering/cache/` with the 9 core CE skills.

### Audit System

Before launching a profile, AgentDock audits it against `compatibility-rules.json`:

- **Model capability check** — Verifies the model can handle the task tier (`light`/`standard`/`advanced`)
- **CE compatibility check** — For CE workflows, verifies the frontend supports CE and has sufficient context
- **Context check** — Warns if `required_context` exceeds the model's known limit
- **Auto-suggestions** — Suggests up to 2 alternative profiles if the current one has warnings

Audit results:
- **Errors** block launch until resolved
- **Warnings** require user confirmation before proceeding
- **Suggestions** are informational and non-blocking

## File Conventions

### Profiles (`profiles/*.md`)

Every profile must start with frontmatter delimited by `---`:

```markdown
---
id: my-profile
name: My Profile
task_mode: safe-audit
mode: local
frontend: ollama
backend: ollama
model: llama3.1:8b
required_context: 8192
required_env:
  - OPENAI_API_KEY
---

Description here.

```powershell launch
# Launch script goes here
ollama run llama3.1:8b
```
```

Required frontmatter fields:
- `name` (string)
- One of `goal`, `task_mode`, or `mode`
- One of `stack`, `frontend`, or `backend`
- At least one ````powershell launch` block

### Memory (`memory.md`)

Use evidence blocks so `memoryBlocks()` can parse them:

```markdown
## Evidence: profile-id run
Date: 2026-01-01T00:00:00Z
Profile: profile-id
Status: blocked
Observed: exitCode=1
Reason: Model context too low
```

Status values: `success`, `known-good`, `observed-run`, `blocked`, `failure`, `observed-failure`.

### Project Brain (`.agentdock/project-brain/*`)

Every repo that participates in the shared portfolio pipeline should maintain a canonical project-brain directory:

- `.agentdock/project-brain/summary.md`
- `.agentdock/project-brain/current-state.md`
- `.agentdock/project-brain/graph.json`
- `.agentdock/project-brain/wiki/index.md`
- `.agentdock/project-brain/artifacts.json`

Required coordination rules:
- `current-state.md` is the authoritative repo-wide pipeline snapshot for concurrent agents.
- `current-state.md` must include `Timestamp`, `Plan-Version`, `Milestone-Version`, and `Canonical-For-Project: true`.
- `artifacts.json` and `graph.json` must mirror the same timestamp/version family in machine-readable form.
- At session end, always try to refresh the repo's project-brain snapshot before stopping.
- Versioning is project-wide, not agent-local: all agents working the same repo should converge on the same build-plan and milestone versions.

## Safety Model

- **No arbitrary commands** — Only profile-defined PowerShell blocks are executed.
- **Preview warnings** — Dangerous patterns (`remove-item`, `git push`, `iex`, etc.) trigger warnings.
- **Secret redaction** — `.env` values are redacted; only key names and provider hints are shown.
- **Localhost only** — Binds to `127.0.0.1`. No cloud telemetry.
- **Session monitoring** — All launches are tracked, logged, and written to local memory.
- **Auto-blocking** — Two consecutive failures on the same project auto-block the profile in memory.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `EADDRINUSE` on startup | Kill the existing Node process on port 7777 or set `AGENTDOCK_PORT` to another port. |
| Scanner returns empty JSON | Ensure PowerShell is installed and `scanner.ps1` is not blocked by execution policy. Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process`. |
| Gemini chat not responding | Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable. Without it, the advisor falls back to rule-based output. |
| Profiles not showing | Verify `profiles/` exists and contains `.md` files with valid frontmatter. Check `npm test` output. |
| Sessions not appearing in terminal | Check browser console for network errors. Ensure the server is running on the expected port. |
| CE skills not showing in UI | Run `node scripts/sync-ce-skills.js` to download skill definitions. Verify `skills/compound-engineering/cache/` exists and contains `.md` files. |
| Audit blocks a CE profile launch | Check `compatibility-rules.json` for model capability and CE compatibility rules. Use a frontend with full CE support (`claude` or `codex`) or select a lower-tier task. |
| Sync script fails with timeout | The GitHub raw CDN may be slow. Retry or increase timeout in `scripts/sync-ce-skills.js` (`req.setTimeout(ms)`) or `scripts/sync-ce-skills.ps1` (`-TimeoutSec`). |

## API Key Vault (local)

AgentDock auto-imports API keys on every scan and at server startup:

| Source | Harvested into |
|--------|------------------|
| Process / user / machine env | `state/key-vault.json` |
| Scanned `.env` file paths | Same vault (values read server-side only) |
| Settings UI manual entry | `POST /api/keys` |

**Used for:** AI Coach (`chat.js`), profile evaluation, Stack Builder cloud checks, launch sessions (`createSession` injects vault env).

**API:** `GET /api/keys` (masked only), `POST /api/keys`, `POST /api/keys/sync`

**Display:** UI shows last 3 characters (`•••••••abc`). Full values never returned by API.

**Session start checklist:** Read `AGENTS.md`, `docs/plans/` latest milestone, and `.agentdock/project-brain/current-state.md` if present before large changes.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `AGENTDOCK_PORT` | Server port (default `7777`) |
| `AGENTDOCK_DEBUG` | Include stack traces in 500 errors |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Gemini API key — auto-imported to vault on scan/startup |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Alternative Gemini API key — same vault |
